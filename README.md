# Pet Box Subscription analysis

The original [assignment](docs/Assignment.pdf) and [data file](input/pet_sales.csv)
were provided by [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/). This project was 
originally used for my
[Data Analyst Associate certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0016698068691).
I use it now to showcase my work.


The data analysis is located in the [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd) and the written report
is located on my [DataCamp profile](https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/a3a8ffa5-3924-4746-9f40-5e9c8648c245)
