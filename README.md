# Pet Box Subscription analysis

The original [assignment](docs/Assignment.pdf) and [data file](input/pet_sales.csv)
were provided by [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/). This project was 
originally used for my
[Data Analyst Associate certification](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DA0016698068691).
I use it now to showcase my work.


The data analysis is located in the [analysis.Rmd](analysis.Rmd) and a supporting
results overview is located in [docs/...](docs/...). The written results outline
the main takeaways and answers to business questions.
